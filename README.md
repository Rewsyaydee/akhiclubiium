# AKHI CLUB IIUM - Outreach & Character

Welcome to the official repository for the **AKHI CLUB IIUM** website. This platform serves as a digital gateway to our initiatives, bridging the gap between higher education and primary growth through Islamic character building and community outreach.

The website is designed with a modern, "blueprint" aesthetic (Cyanotype theme) to reflect our mission of architectural character building.
